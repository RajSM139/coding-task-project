# task-project

- It is a NodeJS Project created using SailsJS Framework. The version of the Sails used is 0.12
- After clone, run ```npm install```
- Note: **You need to have Node and Sails(v0.12) installed in your system**
- To avoid the requirement of MySQL database for code testing, I am using default ```localDiskDb``` connection. It will work just like a SQL DB.
- To run, ```npm start``` or ```node app.js```.
- Open browser and enter ```localhost:1337``` with the API URL.
- Before trying TASK 2 and TASK 3, run ```/api/v1/create-product-categories```. It will create dummy category and products.
